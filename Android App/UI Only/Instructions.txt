Android App UI

IDE Used: Android Studio
Designated API: Version 27, Android 8.1 Oreo
Test Device: Google Pixel 2

This Android application is the framework for the UI and navigational component of our project that will later be combined with the Firebase implementation app.

Our application is still a work in progress and has not been built into an APK with gradle yet, therefore it will only run in an emulated environment.

In order to run the application for testing purposes, install the latest version of Andriod Studio and simply open the "rubus" project folder.

You will be required to create an Android virtual device to run the application on. This feature is included with Android Studio.
