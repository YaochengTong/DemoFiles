We generated fake data of 1,000 students, 2,500 students, 
10,000 students, by random function in excel.
We distributed some part of requests in order to show in demo.

For Data collection, Since we have Firebase hosting, there is no local file
and also the scripts to collect data are in part of android app source code.
